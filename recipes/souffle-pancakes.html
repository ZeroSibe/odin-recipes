        <li>1.5 cups flour - spooned and leveled </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li>0.5 teapsoon salt </li>
        <li>1.25 cups dairy milk </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter - melted </li>

        <li>1 large egg yolk - plus 3 large egg whites</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>syrup and powdered sugar for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl whisk together flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, and salt. </li>
        <li>In a second bowl stir together milk, melted butter, vanilla or almond extract, and the egg yolk. </li>
        <li>In a third bowl whip the egg whites and cream of tartar 3-4 minutes until stiff peaks form. </li>

        <li>Preheat a deep skillet with a lid over low heat and spray the inside of a 3-inch baking ring (I used three rings at a time) with nonstick spray and place in the preheating pan.</li>
        <li>Fill each ring halfway full with batter. Place lid on the pan and allow to cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide a spatula underneath to life the pancake and ring and use tongs to quickly flip it over. Allow to cook another 2-3 minutes until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
